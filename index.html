              <br>
              <p>
                As a person that has quite an experience in dealing with different kind of people I know that it is crucial
                for effective communication to be on the same page with people you are dealing with. Especially in 
                professional area. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Soft skills are as important as tech skills, especially in such a middle role that is DevOps.
                Being effective DevOps means to put on different roles every day, working with people in synergy, helping them and/or 
                asking for their input when it's necessary.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's also important to share the expertise between the members of the team. This is achieved through demos, one to one mentoring,
                interactive work on tasks where the shared expertise is required, documenting and presenting know-hows.

        <p> 
          After College I wasn't sure what to do, I had no idea how things work. Even though I have had courses like OS, Architecture, OOP, Mobile devlopment and databases course, php, java etc... However I did not see the big picture of things. 
          I figured that since I liked linux since highschool I'd stick to that as a core value. I went to some job interviews for entry level php dev and others but figured that that's not what I wanna do.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was reading into tanenbaum's books, OS, Networks etc and I figured Samsung would be best fit for me at the time. I mean, android's practically linux, right? Also Samsung looks fine on the resume as a first job. 
          They hired me for my fluent english and interest in technology, however the position was not in the RnD, rather at the Business and Sales for CIS department. 
        </p>

        <h2>Samsung</h2>

        <p> 
          It was fun time but not very fulfilling profession-wise. And the pay was low too. 
          Nearest I got to command line at that time is when I was tinkering with monkeyrunner and adb to 
          play with configs for some side project my mentor had. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile I was reading through articles and everything that I could put my hands on, 
          Ruby on Rails was the hot thing at the time so I was trying to get good at that. 
          Learned about ORM, Active Records, scaffilding and other concepts but did not go past that.
          I did not understand how RoR works because it was so high level. I felt anxiety whenever I was using it, 
          all the stacktraces and stuff were really scary and stackoverflow wasn't as big as it is now. 
          So I kept learning, re-learning stuff they were feeding me in College but with my own spin on it.
          I worked at Samsung for 8 months and then went to another compoany to work for twice as big of a salary. 
        </p>

        <h2> QA Sberbank </h2>
        <p> 
          After I dispatched Samsung and started working at Sberbank I understood that I am in a bad place. The environment was very toxic,
          people were even drinking strong alcohol at the job sometimes when someone had a birthday, going out to smoke all the time and the job looked interesting at first 
          but the atmosphere and general bureaucracy took all the fun out of it. They were developing online banking web app 'sberbank-online' and it was quite interesting but 
          quickly I felt that I am in a wrong place. I worked there for 3 months and then bailed to study properly and to find more fulfilling job.
        </p>

        <h2> AMarkets RoR </h2>
        <p> 
          So I was learning the tech jargon and OOP and classes and what not, I mean re-learning the stuff I had in College, when I got an invitation to the 
          AMarkets Forex company. They gave us some tests and asked us for some theory questions, typical questions that you hear on a entry-level interview, like 
          what is OOP, why it exists, what are three principles (classic). So I passed that with flying flags but when 
          the internship itself actually started I figured that I don't know a thing. And they weren't that good at 
          teaching either. We had a group of interns that were tought RoR development by a sys-admin. And the anxiety 
          also kicked in. So I figured I am doing something wrong and bailed yet again. Went home and studied some more. 
          Played some dota and battlefield and studied some. Tanenbaum still was on me, Linux API Programming, some 
          kernighan and ritchie. Linux System administration. Some python too, bash. Free online courses and materials etc.

        </p>

        <h2> Junior SDET Virtuozzo - SDET </h2>
        <p> 
          Once I saw a job openning for Junior SDET at Virtuozzo, a company that develops it's own linux distro called 
          (surprise) Virtuzzo. They even had their own container technology called OpenVZ. I figured they are 
          never gonna hire me but I thought it's worth the shot. I was reading and learning as much as I could about everything, so 
          when I came to the job interview and saw these guys my heart rate jumped and I was rumbling like crazy. 
          I was talking nonsense about virtual memory and paging and MBRs and harddrives, block devices etc. 
          I said that I am reading tanenbaums books and the guy asked what exactly did I like it in these books. 
          I found nothing better than to say I like everything. I felt like that interview was a disaster but they still 
          hired me nevertheless.   
        </p>
        <p> 
          It all was fine and dandy but I guess I am a rather greedy person as to the technologies and skills. 
          While I was working on my main tasks me and my friends were tinkering with ethereum network, eth mining. 
          Also I was getting into nodejs, it looked like a cool iteration of web framework after RoR. It had cool stuff 
          with packaging and scaffolding from RoR but also introduced some if it's own perks. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          Going to Virtuozzo I figured I will be able to get rid of my anxiety and get to know all the 
          nuts and bolts under the hood, on low leve. I wasn't wrong, I got what I wanted. I worked there for 
          1,5yrs and even though I wouldn't be able to write my own kernel in C, I got comfortable going up and down the stack 
          investigating what went wrong. Some cool DevOps guys showed me how I could look into specifics of python, looking around CPython or 
          going all around the libraries that a program uses and specific implementation of a some method that uses 
          specific syscalls. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          I also re-learned the computer architecture with <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/ "> NandToTetris</a> course. 
        </p>
 
        <h2> Kraftway</h2>
        <p>
          So after I got bored at Virtuozzo I figured I wanna go even more low-level. Once again they offered me 2x salary at new place. Now I was working as a Senior SDET developing a strategy
          for testing of a in-house built NVMe SSD block device that had ARM chips in it and was handling writes and reads of memory chips. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          Once again I found myself in a situation like the one I was in before at Sberbank. The environment was quite toxic, alcohol consumption at the work place wasn't something strange
          at that place. Topping the fact that they started postponment with the salary payments the second month together with me realizing that I don't wanna do QA at all anymore I resigned.
        </p>
        <p> 
          I decided to take some time off again and get into DevOpsy stuff more thoroughly. By the time I was quite fluent with python, react, nodejs, kubernetes, vagrant and also had some minor experience with AWS EC2.
          I figured I'll give it a shot. The tipping point was when I came to a job interview for a Senior SDET in a small open-space packed with people and rather 
          unpleasant lady told me that I had no chance finding DevOps job cuz I had no formal experience before, it's when I thought "We'll have to see about that".
        </p>

        <h2> Align Technology </h2>
        <p> 
          So once again I found some cool job opening that I thought I would have no chances getting into but guys were so happy with my linux and python skills that
          even though I had no previous experience working as a "DevOps engineer" they hired me as a regular (middle) DevOps. No x2 salary this time thought, but it was enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was on a team of people working on a microservice. Java developers, analysts, QA, PM etc. It was a rather simple microservice that 
          required an RDS, S3 bucket, some SGs and API endpoint. I was an so-called "Embedded DevOps", meaning 
          we had a core team that was developing core framework, typically consisting of bash/python wrapper code around 
          terraform modules that would parametrize an environment, create EC2 instances and deploy Rancher1.6 Cattle there along with secondary 
          tools like Consul, S3 buckets etc. 
          I would also have my own wrapper around terraform that would deploy Java app and create app-specific aws resources. 
          
        </p>
        <p>
          I worked there for over a year and figure it's time to move on to something more fun. 
          I wanted to get into Core Team but things weren't exactly the way I wanted over there. 
          I didn't like the idea of me supporting legacy ec2-based infra framework, I liked k8s 
          way more. So I started looking for some options. 
        </p>

        <h2> CustomerTimes </h2>
        <p>
          As discussed with my manager I was working on the core multicloud k8s-based environment that we 
          planned to reuse for the clients of our company. I had implemented and finetuned some terraform modules for k8s 
          like ECR, EKS, S3, state storage app-specific stuff, gitlabci pipeline that would test our terraform modules for aws, 
          helped junior devops with module implementations for azure cloud, advised on the cloud architecture. 
          
        </p>
        <p>
          However by the end of the third month another engineer that was working with 
          one of the biggest clients the company had - amway - had left the company so they 
          needed some one to put in his place so they decided to put me as the most experienced 
          engineer in their team at the time. They were hosting SAP Hybris using just 
          bare EC2 instances, the environment was quite toxic, the solutions were unreliable.
          They were using NFS servers installed to EC2 instances along with hybris and solr. 
          The development servers would periodically go down due to memory leaks, developers 
          would break things and blame devops. It wasn't something I expected when I went to work there. 
          I tried to fix things beginning from communications inbetween the teams, ending with 
          creating epics and giving tasks to the devops team lead, it was bizare. 
          They even forgot to match the offered salary after first 3 months of work (probation period).
          I quickly burned out and figured that there's no point continuing. I blame the management.
        </p>


        <h2> OnTarget - ServiceTrade, Apiture </h2>
        
        <p>
          After that experience at CT I figured that I want to work with the US but I was hesitant to start the 
          indiviual interpreneurship, hence I found a company that resels people to the west and they made me offer 
          x2 previous salary. They said that I would have to work on one project first but then another one might be 
          added if I do good.   
        </p>
        <p>
          So after 2 weeks on one of the projects in the US based company, people-wise, I felt like
          I belong there. One of the engineers even said that it feels like I am from somewhere in texas rather 
          than in Russia. It was fun and the tasks were fine, a lot of legacy 
          stuff though, like meteorjs, LAMP stacks and whatnot. I was quite happy working at that startup 
          when came news from my russia-based employer. They wanted me to work on two different companies with 
          different stacks, holding daily meetings at the same time, so I would have to talk to two teams of engineers 
          everyday simultaniously and supporting two projects. That would've meant almost 12-15 hrs of works daily which 
          I figured would be too stressful and unproductive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now I am looking for a startup or a company with a complicated tech stack to go full in. I like owning the 
          project, the product, knowing all the pieces and details and enhancing and expanding it incrementally. I don't like 
          good ol' sys-admin like approach to devops where developers do their stuff and so-called "DevOps Engineers" do their CI/CD magic. 
        </p>
        <p>
          So here I am in my pursuit of happinness.
